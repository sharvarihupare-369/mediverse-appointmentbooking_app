MEdiVerse  is an online booking appointment website where user or patient can book their appointment digitally with the doctor they want to visit.A website where patients connect with their potential doctors.
If you have an extensive database, doctors might find it difficult to search through all those profiles.
Thatâ€™s where a search option can be helpful. It allows patients to filter the profiles by desired doctor ratings, and more.

Once a patient chooses a physician, they should be able to easily navigate available appointment dates and time slots. The fewer steps it takes to book a visit, the better.
